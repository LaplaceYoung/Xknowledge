# Loki Mode - Working Memory
**Current Phase:** Implementation (Phase 7 - UI/UX)
**Status:** In Progress

## Current Task
- **Task 20**: 引入 react-window 实现书签列表的虚拟滚动.
  - **Goal**: Implement virtual scrolling for the bookmarks list to improve performance when there are many items.

## Mistakes & Learnings
- Cleaned up duplicate tasks (17, 19, 24, 32) from the `task.md` roadmap.
- Remember that Bash tool working directories persist between commands.
- For blocking actions like `window.confirm`, a Toast notification is not a suitable replacement. A custom Modal/Dialog is needed, which is a separate task.

## Pending Fixes
- None

## History
- Phase 1-6 completed successfully.
- Completed Tasks 8, 9, 6, 18, 22 (Global Toast Notifications).
- Cleaned up duplicate tasks.
